<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span>
<span>Somnolent, vast, inert, the darkness lay</span><br />
<span>Waiting for dawn. Across the ocean stirred</span><br />
<span>A luminous haze, not light, but whispering light,</span><br />
<span>So softly yet, the islands had not heard.</span><br />
<span>The mystery of sleep was in the trees</span><br />
<span>And on the weary stars. A little cry</span><br />
<span>That broke the silence seemed a sacrilege.</span><br />
<span>Then thro' the palm trees glided like a ghost</span><br />
<span>A dusky form; the curtain of the dark</span><br />
<span>Was rent with life, the forest brought forth men.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Instinct with morning every eye was bright,</span><br />
<span>Tho' sleep so lately lay across their lids.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
<span>No sinister intent had called them forth</span><br />
<span>Upon the shadows. May held out her hands,</span><br />
<span>And all the men who dared the dangerous sport</span><br />
<span>Were faring where the great bonita played,&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Strong shining fish below the mid sea waves.</span><br />
<span>Upon the beach beneath the paling moon</span><br />
<span>The boats were launched. Amid the busy stir</span><br />
<span>One man stood idle; as a chief might order,</span><br />
<span>He bade the youths prepare his long canoe.</span><br />
<span>With folded arms he gravely watched the rest</span><br />
<span>And gave them salutation haughtily.</span><br />
<span>Uhila<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was he called, and in his veins</span><br />
<span>There ran a slender stream of northern blood.</span><br />
<span>He bore upon his old and indolent heart,</span><br />
<span>Scarred with the sins of war, a white device.</span><br />
<span>Taka, daughter of chiefs and Fiji's pride,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>Lily of maidens, was betrothed to him;<br />
<span>Desirous eyes kinged him with envy's crown.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">[1]</a> The lightning.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Scraping across the beach the boats were launched,</span><br />
<span>And as they touched the waves, they seemed to take</span><br />
<span>New shape and dignity with that caress</span><br />
<span>Of little lapping ripples round the prow.</span><br />
<span>Uhila led the fleet as one who knew</span><br />
<span>His right by reason of his age and skill.</span><br />
<span>The little isle seemed now a sleeping maid</span><br />
<span>Kirtled in green, the beach her snowy breast</span><br />
<span>Veined with the purple brooks that sought the sea.</span><br />
<span>Uhila watched it fade below the blue,</span><br />
<span>Crouched in the bow, his grizzled chin in hand,</span><br />
<span>Taking his ease, while small Kuma, keen-eyed,</span><br />
<span>Famed for his daring, paddled lustily.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
<span>The dawn had not yet broken, and the soft</span><br />
<span>Beautiful haze that veils the birth of day</span><br />
<span>Hung on the water. Loath to break the peace,</span><br />
<span>Men gave their orders in hushed tones, the clean</span><br />
<span>Chill of the morning wrapt their naked bodies.</span><br />
<span>Then, as a slow blush mounts the cheek, a light</span><br />
<span>Breathed from the sea, and all the air seemed warm</span><br />
<span>As at the touch of spring, a violet streak,</span><br />
<span>A pale leaf green, a golden, and a rose</span><br />
<span>Broke in the sky, and morning was revealed.</span><br />
<span>With a shrill cry, young Kuma raised his hand</span><br />
<span>And pointed where with dip and shriek and wheel</span><br />
<span>A flock of sea birds hovered; all the rest</span><br />
<span>Echoed the call and bending to the paddle</span><br />
<span>Shot o'er the waves, for now the fish were gained.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
<span>Uhila grasped his rod, and at the stern</span><br />
<span>Tossed out the shining hook, with laugh and cheer</span><br />
<span>A glint of silver flashed, then all the air</span><br />
<span>Was gemmed with streaming stars. They came from deeps;</span><br />
<span>From azure fairer than its mother sky</span><br />
<span>Clouded with dazzling whitenesses of foam.</span><br />
<span>Luck to their fishing:</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i8'>Now, fair and remote</span><br />
<span>A scattered emerald from a broken chain</span><br />
<span>Lying below the bending breast of heaven,</span><br />
<span>The village had awakened,&mdash;once again</span><br />
<span>Serene Kambara, island of the south,</span><br />
<span>Exhaled its light upon the light of heaven.</span><br />
<span>The verdure seemed to shine with lucent green,</span><br />
<span>The red hibiscus burned with inward flame,</span><br />
<span>And in the village happy song and shout</span><br />
<span>Proclaimed the day was fair. Blue upon blue</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span>The bright waves glittered like a shattered star</span><br />
<span>Set in the silver crescent of the sand.</span><br />
<span>The palm trees' plume uplifted dauntlessly</span><br />
<span>To call the morning. At the forest's brim</span><br />
<span>The day was made alive by human flowers,</span><br />
<span>Sweet maidens who against the emerald</span><br />
<span>Showed warm and brown in purest harmony.</span><br />
<span>The fierce bright flame that is the tropic sea</span><br />
<span>Burned on their eyes and called them to its heart.</span><br />
<span>Like eager sea birds they forgot the land,</span><br />
<span>And, happy as the amorous waves, they gave</span><br />
<span>Their slim brown bodies to the sea's embrace.</span><br />
<span>They found them driftwood and astride they leapt</span><br />
<span>The feathered breakers, one with daring skill</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<span>Curved her sweet length to lie within the palm</span><br />
<span>Of a strong wave, and so was brought to shore.</span><br />
<span>"Taka," they cried, "has beaten us;" and all,</span><br />
<span>Shaking the bright drops from their shining hair,</span><br />
<span>With laugh and song sprang to the beach again,</span><br />
<span>Sunning themselves to languor ere they made</span><br />
<span>Their pretty toilet.</span><br />
<span>Some had gathered flowers</span><br />
<span>In fragrant wreaths, and others brought the grave</span><br />
<span>Work of the morning. Yet because the wine&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Sun of the South&mdash;gilds even toil, it seemed</span><br />
<span>A poet's pastime. Scarlet beans they threaded</span><br />
<span>Later to lie about some golden throat.</span><br />
<span>Deftly they wove fine mats, and deftly twisted</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>Bright witchery to adorn themselves, and snare<br />
<span>Men's eyes. With little songs they pearled the air.</span><br />
<span>Hush! it is Taka singing:&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span class='i4'>"Far away</span><br />
<span>In a fountain dwelt a maiden;</span><br />
<span>When the silver moon was high</span><br />
<span>She was glad, but heavy laden</span><br />
<span>Was she when its light must die.</span><br />
<span class='i4'>Far away.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span class='i4'>"Far away</span><br />
<span>Came a stranger brave to love her,</span><br />
<span>Loved her when the moon was high;</span><br />
<span>When the moon was pale above her</span><br />
<span>Love grew pale and like to die</span><br />
<span class='i4'>Far away.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span class='i4'>"Far away</span><br />
<span>From the fountain's mist he drew her</span><br />
<span>Happy while the moon was high,</span><br />
<span>Waning, fled she, her pursuer</span><br />
<span>Held her back, and saw her die</span><br />
<span class='i4'>Far away."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
<span>"'T is a sad song for morning," cried the maids&mdash;</span><br />
<span>"And for a bride. Come, Hopa, sing of laughter."</span><br />
<span>Hopa sang:&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span>"Little brown streams,</span><br />
<span>Slim as my fingers,</span><br />
<span>Running and laughing</span><br />
<span>While the light lingers,</span><br />
<span>Have you no dreams,</span><br />
<span>Little brown streams?</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span>"Little brown maidens,</span><br />
<span>Laughing and weeping,</span><br />
<span>Singing and dancing,</span><br />
<span>All the night sleeping,</span><br />
<span>Have you no lovers,</span><br />
<span>Little brown maidens?"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Afar there sounded in the mellow breeze</span><br />
<span>The rhythmic movement of the maidens' toil;</span><br />
<span>Before them on the sand a snowy sheet</span><br />
<span>Lay spread,&mdash;the tapa cloth; tutunga trees</span><br />
<span>Yield them their inner bark, and lightly then</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
<span>The maidens tap the fibres till they join,</span><br />
<span>Made firm with scented gums and bright with dyes,</span><br />
<span>To form a fabric that a bride might choose,</span><br />
<span>And this was for a bride. Among the rest</span><br />
<span>One maiden shone; a moon beside her stars,</span><br />
<span>Taka, the fair. Her father was the chief</span><br />
<span>Of this small village. His the splendid store</span><br />
<span>Of kava bowls for which the isle is famed,</span><br />
<span>The shining fish-hooks, fairest of mother of pearl,</span><br />
<span>Great mats from ancient days with border rare</span><br />
<span>Of crimson feathers, cruel tragic spears,</span><br />
<span>Sweet unguents, necklaces of pearly shells</span><br />
<span>Envied by maidens, and above them all</span><br />
<span>Bales of the snowy tapa, made by hands</span><br />
<span>Subtle, wise hands of women, over whom</span><br />
<span>The earth had long laid flowers.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i8'>In the land</span><br />
<span>Where history is but a charming tale</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
<span>Droned by old men at twilight, future days</span><br />
<span>Pleasantly certain as the next repast,</span><br />
<span>Where gods and goddesses appear as  birds,</span><br />
<span>Trees, plants or moonlight, gently rising  tide,</span><br />
<span>And shining girdle of leaves,&mdash;all homely  things,</span><br />
<span>Which hold the people's hearts.&mdash;In this  fair land</span><br />
<span>Taka was born. Thro' sixteen years of  moon</span><br />
<span>And tropic sun she blossomed in the air.</span><br />
<span>Chilled by no frost, the world unconsciously</span><br />
<span>Mirrored her sweetness back to her. The sun</span><br />
<span>Had kissed her skin to a warm topaz;  rare</span><br />
<span>As dusky wealth of Autumn, her sweet breast,</span><br />
<span>Gleaming and bare, was hung with ropes of flowers</span><br />
<span>Yellow and white, and in her curling hair</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<span>Glimmered the pure gardenia. All the  braves</span><br />
<span>Wished her for wife, but old Akau the  chief,</span><br />
<span>Knowing Uhila's prowess and the blood</span><br />
<span>Left by an English forbear in his veins,</span><br />
<span>Knowing that Taka too could boast, or  mourn,</span><br />
<span>A foreign ancestry, had lately pledged</span><br />
<span>His daughter to this brave, and now the  village</span><br />
<span>Made preparations for the marriage. There</span><br />
<span>By the warm sea the maidens paid their  court</span><br />
<span>To Taka, who so soon would leave their  gay</span><br />
<span>Indifferent frolic lives to wed the grave</span><br />
<span>Stern chief. She did not falter at the  choice.</span><br />
<span>Love which the maidens sang was but a  word;</span><br />
<span>She wished no better fate than to be  mated</span><br />
<span>To a strong warrior whom her heart held  dear</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
<span>As friend to kind Akau. So she waited.</span><br />
<span>In her slim hands she held a polished cup,</span><br />
<span>The shell of cocoanut, which caught the  light</span><br />
<span>Like a brown pool. The toil of many days</span><br />
<span>Had turned the tawny shade to warmest black</span><br />
<span>In gradual depths as shaded Taka's cheek;</span><br />
<span>With perfumed oil her fingers gave caress</span><br />
<span>And waked the hidden pictures in the grain,</span><br />
<span>The yellow sand, the dusky amber girl,</span><br />
<span>The brown perfected in the shining globe.</span><br />
<span>Earth's monotones are justified in this.</span><br />
<span>Close to her lolled small Hopa, blithe and gay</span><br />
<span>As a young cricket, teasing all the rest</span><br />
<span>With her sharp wit; often she dropped her work&mdash;</span><br />
<span>The threading of bright flowers into wreaths&mdash;</span><br />
<span>To look across the waves, and suddenly</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
<span>She called, "A sail, a little sail," and all</span><br />
<span>Followed her pointing fingers. Far away,</span><br />
<span>Tossed like a feather, black against the sky,</span><br />
<span>Hovered a tiny craft, its unknown lines</span><br />
<span>Marked it as stranger, and the maidens all</span><br />
<span>Curiously watched its coming to the shore.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>All night the little shell with ceaseless dip</span><br />
<span>And pause, and rise and dip again, had borne</span><br />
<span>The trackless trade winds. Tui Tua Kau,</span><br />
<span>"King of the Reefs," had ventured over far</span><br />
<span>From Tonga's shore. Caught by a wanton gale,</span><br />
<span>His idle racing, lengthened in a whim</span><br />
<span>To cheat his laughing mates, grew a wild flight.</span><br />
<span>The frail canoe seemed, on the angry sea,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
<span>A sweet rose petal blown across the night.</span><br />
<span>Yet wisely now the winds had mind to crown</span><br />
<span>Their joyous undertaking, and upon</span><br />
<span>The shores of Fiji's isles they drew their prize.</span><br />
<span>The maidens on the shore had seen afar</span><br />
<span>The stranger's coming, and the songs were stilled</span><br />
<span>To hush of expectation. Even so</span><br />
<span>A prince might come to claim his kingdom, lone,</span><br />
<span>In a frail craft, with weary eyes, and hair</span><br />
<span>Crowned with a fading wreath, more beautiful</span><br />
<span>Than all their lovers, slender, strong and young.</span><br />
<span>With one lithe spring he gained the yellow sand</span><br />
<span>And caught the boat and drew it with a swing</span><br />
<span>High on the beach,&mdash;its movement seemed alive.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
<span>His sinewy fingers loosed the flapping sail,</span><br />
<span>Gay shells clinked musical against the mast,</span><br />
<span>And all the maidens, timorous as birds,</span><br />
<span>Laughed at the sound with shy averted face.</span><br />
<span>Then straight and slender as the cocoa palm,</span><br />
<span>Straight as its shaft and crowned with shining hair,</span><br />
<span>The stranger lifted up his head. The wreath,</span><br />
<span>Faded yet still alive thro' ocean's breath,</span><br />
<span>Drooped o'er his brows. His flashing sun-bright eyes</span><br />
<span>Struck thro' the group of girls as shoots a dart,</span><br />
<span>And caught and quivered in sweet Taka's breast.</span><br />
<span>More noble than the rest, she scorned to fear,</span><br />
<span>And graceful in her modesty she faltered,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
<span>Then came to meet and greet the stranger  guest.</span><br />
<span>Erect she faced him, o'er her brow the frail</span><br />
<span>Curves of the crest she wore, antenn&aelig;-wise,</span><br />
<span>Trembled a little. As a maid beseems,</span><br />
<span>Her eyes drooped from his gaze, yet not too soon</span><br />
<span>To miss the gleam with which he caught the first</span><br />
<span>Flash of her beauty. With that glance he gained&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Half conscious of a gladness&mdash;that this maid</span><br />
<span>Was still for winning. As the custom is</span><br />

<span>I am a beggar at your mercy." Then</span><br />
<span>The young pride mounting to his cheek, he cried,</span><br />
<span>"Nay, but I jested, for I come so far</span><br />

<span>They left the hut together. From the clear</span><br />
<span>Bright heat of noon they turned, and took their way</span><br />
<span>Into the greenly silent forest. Leaves</span><br />
<span>Flickered above wet blossoms, simple sounds</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sit in the dark alone."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Then of the gods they sang,&mdash;a moonlight song:</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sleep, O soft little winds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Restless whispering grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reeds of the water-ways sway not,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleep, that the gods may pass.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Deepen, you dreams of the sleepers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Veil you, O fire of the moon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Darken, you silver of stars,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleep, for the gods come soon.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanzp2">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sleep, for the gods who sleep not</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mystical, magical, secret,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleep, for to wake is death."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>And after singing came the dance; the brown</span><br />
<span>Lithe women decked with bright fantastic hues</span><br />
<span>Wavered into the circle of the light.</span><br />
<span>Kneeling, they wove their spells. As gracious flowers</span><br />
<span>Swayed by the winds of evening, they were blown</span><br />
<span>By breezes of desire. The eye was filled</span><br />
<span>With luxury of soft motion and the sound</span><br />
<span>Of soft monotonous chanting charmed the ear.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
<span>Then in their midst came Taka, and she stood,</span><br />
<span>Waiting the signal. Slow she raised her arms,</span><br />
<span>Slow as tho' ages hung upon her hands</span><br />
<span>Heavy with burdened love. The music hushed.</span><br />
<span>Deep in the mystery of her steady eyes</span><br />
<span>Lingered the secret of the world, and then</span><br />
<span>Laughter and light came dancing from her smile.</span><br />
<span>Her fingers fluttered on the harp of love,</span><br />
<span>And every chord uttered itself again</span><br />
<span>Within some dusky heart. The earth was still.</span><br />
<span>The warm night air was strong with heavy scent</span><br />
<span>Of oil upon the dancers and the flowers</span><br />
<span>That decked their breasts and hair. Malua's soul</span><br />
<span>Fainted beneath the load of so much love,</span><br />
<span>And when the dance was finished, and her eyes</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
<span>Held him for one long second ere she smiled</span><br />
<span>And stole away, he knew for death or life</span><br />
<span>His spirit lay within her golden hands.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Woe for Uhila! As the twilight glow</span><br />
<span>Faded in soft immeasurable plains</span><br />
<span>Of darkness, so the beauty in his heart</span><br />
<span>Faded in clouds of wrath. The great fire blazed&mdash;</span><br />
<span>A ruby in the raven hair of night&mdash;</span><br />
<span>And clear across the flames Uhila saw</span><br />
<span>His rival, garlanded with blossoms, pale,</span><br />
<span>Calm as a happy lover. Could he smile</span><br />
<span>Over his empty hands and meekly bow&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Uhila bow!&mdash;to taste a stranger's whip!</span><br />
<span>Death snapped the sparks, and Vengeance hurled the flames.</span><br />
<span>Like blood the fire fell o'er the bare young heart,</span><br />
<span>And he who watched in one mad bound foresaw</span><br />
<span>How blood indeed might flash across that breast.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
<span>The high resolve grew dim in that fierce light,</span><br />
<span>"'Tis noble, strong;" then, in a stab of keen</span><br />
<span>Humor, he saw again a native brave</span><br />
<span>Decking his naked body with the coat</span><br />
<span>Crowned with the hat of some sea-faring man,&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Aping the civilization of his stride</span><br />
<span>Till his new prowess fell to comrade's jeers.</span><br />
<span>So with a tiger heart it were to wear</span><br />
<span>A grave forgiveness of this wanton wrong.</span><br />
<span>The primal lust had burst the slender bar,</span><br />
<span>Weak white man's morals. Now to slay and slay.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Darkling, he fixed Malua with his eyes,</span><br />
<span>Noting each shadow of his changing thoughts,</span><br />
<span>When the dear dreams centred on Taka, dreams</span><br />
<span>Dimming his sight. Holding his lips apart,</span><br />
<span>He slowly rose, Uhila following,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
<span>For in the dark the music of her face</span><br />
<span>Smote on the boy till he could bear no more</span><br />
<span>The feasting and the firelight; silently</span><br />
<span>He rose and stole away. The night was still,</span><br />
<span>And "Taka, Taka, Taka," rang his soul</span><br />
<span>Against the stars. He felt infinity</span><br />
<span>Above him brood, and knew the mighty gods,</span><br />
<span>Who once in every lifetime drop an hour</span><br />
<span>Of their remembrance fraught with godlike bliss</span><br />
<span>To luckless man, had turned on him their eyes.</span><br />
<span>Unconsciously his feet retraced the path</span><br />
<span>To the dark pool where joy had birth that day.</span><br />
<span>The scents that wake when the cool dusk begins</span><br />
<span>Lapped him luxuriously; the heavy sweet</span><br />
<span>Of passionate gardenia,&mdash;kiss made flower,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
<span>White as his turbulent love, was as the crown</span><br />
<span>And climax of the jasmine stars that breathed</span><br />
<span>His love in placid day, and when he paused</span><br />
<span>Beside the pool, the forest held its breath.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>"O sweet, O beautiful!" Malua cried,</span><br />
<span>His young eyes blazing to the tropic night.</span><br />
<span>"Never before, since all the gods were young,</span><br />
<span>Was woman loved as I love Taka." Then,</span><br />
<span>Caught in a very ecstasy of love,</span><br />
<span>He laid his arms about a slender tree,</span><br />
<span>White in the moonlight, and his fevered cheek</span><br />
<span>Pressed on its cooling stem. With broken music</span><br />
<span>Shaken from his breast, he cried on Taka,&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Little happy words that mothers whisper</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
<span>Above their sleeping babes. "If love could find</span><br />
<span>A way to utter love without her lips!"</span><br />
<span>Her lips, her eyes, the music of her voice&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Death would be easy on her golden heart.</span><br />
<span>He pictured her at twilight in the door</span><br />
<span>Of their far home, with eager arms outstretched</span><br />
<span>To welcome him from toil; how she would stand</span><br />
<span>A queen among the other women, crowned</span><br />
<span>With crimson flowers. How had he won her, he</span><br />
<span>A stranger to her people and her blood!</span><br />
<span>For in her veins the stream ran pale, but, "Ah,"</span><br />
<span>He cried, "my kiss shall burn it red again.</span><br />
<span>White she may be, a queen, my queen, she is,</span><br />
<span>And still my slave in fetters of my love."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>Uhila watched him from the shadow.</span><br />
<span>Gods!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
<span>How young he was! as Vave, the swift-footed</span><br />
<span>Splendidly strong, an innocent god of war.</span><br />
<span>The morn with chilly lips laid myriad kisses</span><br />
<span>About his beauty, slipped thro' jealous leaves</span><br />
<span>Dripping with silver and fantastic fingers</span><br />
<span>Reached to caress him from the amorous trees.</span><br />
<span>Hither and forth he paced; Uhila's eyes</span><br />
<span>Ached with his hatred of the sight; at length</span><br />
<span>"Taka," Malua cried, and stretched his arms</span><br />
<span>Rigid in air, his face against the sky.</span><br />
<span>The goad was in Uhila's soul, he leapt</span><br />
<span>Into the moonlight and upon his foe.</span><br />
<span>Fixed to the ground, they strove as giant trees</span><br />
<span>Tossing fierce branches in a storm; their wrath</span><br />
<span>Smote on them like a tempest, hot with hate.</span><br />
<span>Malua knew a curse was in the hands</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<span>That sought his throat, and in the blazing eyes</span><br />
<span>Close to his own. Life would defend fair life</span><br />
<span>As chief and Taka's lover. Round the shoulders</span><br />
<span>Dark and strong, straining to his heaving breast,</span><br />
<span>He threw his arms, and locked in that embrace</span><br />
<span>They stood a moment, breathing with the quick</span><br />
<span>Sharp catch of weary runners. Then a turn&mdash;</span><br />
<span>Raising his knee, Uhila strove in vain</span><br />
<span>To throw his enemy. Upon their heads</span><br />
<span>And swaying bodies lay the silver light</span><br />
<span>Of the bright moon. The great night seemed to pause</span><br />
<span>Chin upon hand to watch the struggle, air</span><br />
<span>Hushed to retain the hoarse and laboring sobs</span><br />
<span>Such strain brought forth. Their shining bodies, oiled</span><br />
<span>In honor of the feast, granted no hold</span><br />
<span>To the fierce gripping arms.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i10'>Then suddenly</span><br />
<span>Uhila sprang aside and grasped a branch,</span><br />
<span>A rough, harsh weapon&mdash;for they were unarmed.</span><br />
<span>Wary they watched each other's eyes, like beasts</span><br />
<span>Stealthy, retreating, circling with heads low,</span><br />
<span>Bodies bent for the catch. Malua sprang</span><br />
<span>Close to Uhila, caught his murderous hand,</span><br />
<span>And with the branch between them, all its thorns</span><br />
<span>Tearing their breasts, they strove once more. The moon</span><br />
<span>Glittered in troubled ripples, they had come</span><br />
<span>Under the shadow of the trees, the dark</span><br />
<span>Goaded Uhila's soul anew, his blood,</span><br />
<span>Blazing with conflict, gave him mad-man's strength</span><br />
<span>And devil's skill. His straining form relaxed,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
<span>Heavily slipping earthward; ere Malua</span><br />
<span>Could gain fresh hold upon his fainting foe,</span><br />
<span>Uhila with a twist had laid him low,</span><br />
<span>Knee on his breast, lean fingers at his throat</span><br />
<span>Seizing his life.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i10'>Malua's eyes grew dim,</span><br />
<span>The gentle stars seen faint thro' hanging leaves</span><br />
<span>Wavered uncertainly; his brain seemed black,</span><br />
<span>Confused with horrid death, the dewy moss</span><br />
<span>He lay on failed beneath him. Suddenly</span><br />
<span>Hanging upon the brittle rim of death,</span><br />
<span>His outstretched hand, gripping the scattered leaves,</span><br />
<span>Closed on a sharp stone, instinct more than brain</span><br />
<span>Showed him the way; he raised his weapon, struck</span><br />
<span>And struck and struck again.</span><br />
<span>The night looked down</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
<span>Waning, and saw thro' tangled boughs a still,</span><br />
<span>Dead figure on the troubled earth. All stained</span><br />
<span>With crimson blood, there lay a crimson wreath,</span><br />
<span>And thro' the forest stole a dusky shade</span><br />
<span>Fleeing he knew not where save that he 'scaped</span><br />
<span>Death, that was lying by the forest pool.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span>At dawn the weary boy, who thro' the night</span><br />
<span>Had cried his love and anguish to the dark,</span><br />
<span>Wandering half crazed thro' forest deeps unknown,</span><br />
<span>Feeling upon his throat the hand of hate,</span><br />
<span>Feeling upon his heart the still more potent</span><br />
<span>Fingers of love, came to the open shore</span><br />
<span>Waiting for day. The restless, eager foam,</span><br />
<span>Stretching white arms around the sleeping earth,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
<span>Woke his great love anew. The loneliness</span><br />
<span>Of open spaces set his hungry soul</span><br />
<span>Dreaming of Taka, Taka who should come</span><br />
<span>And fill the empty world for him. The sky</span><br />
<span>Paled at the thought. The dawn was stealing near,</span><br />
<span>Glimmering faintly on the edge of night.</span><br />
<span>He could delay no longer; like a thief</span><br />
<span>He must secure his jewel in the dark.</span><br />
<span>In the vast pause that presages the morn</span><br />
<span>He came to Taka's door. Ajar it stood,</span><br />
<span>And on the mats within he saw revealed</span><br />
<span>The pure young oval of her perfect face.</span><br />
<span>"Taka, my little one," Malua whispered,</span><br />
<span>And thro' her dreams "Malua" passed her lips,</span><br />
<span>Slipping insensibly to waking. So</span><br />
<span>She saw him at the door and came to him,</span><br />
<span>Her dewy dreams still warm within her eyes,</span><br />
<span>And gave her face to passionate caress.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
<span>Then with soft, broken words he told again</span><br />
<span>His love, and after when her heart was full</span><br />
<span>Of glad acceptance, as a flash of fire</span><br />
<span>Searing his image on her soul, he told</span><br />
<span>How blood had paid the price of love.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i12'>She heard,</span><br />
<span>And daylight ebbed before her eyes to faint</span><br />
<span>White mist, then refluent turned and smote</span><br />
<span>Her heart's eyes with the horror of the truth.</span><br />
<span>Uhila dead. Uhila with the smile</span><br />
<span>That woke for her alone. Her thoughts, like leaves</span><br />
<span>Blown by cold winds, were scattered, and the words</span><br />
<span>"Uhila dead" was but a symbol grim</span><br />
<span>Of darkness. All the past, her happy life</span><br />
<span>Flower in the sun, her home, and all the dear</span><br />
<span>Familiar duties, all her life to come</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
<span>Woven with thoughts of kind Uhila, all</span><br />
<span>Struck to the ground by murder. In her blood</span><br />
<span>The pale drops cried to heaven against the wrong,</span><br />
<span>Wrong to her people and her love, till now</span><br />
<span>So beautiful.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i10'>Malua knew her pain,</span><br />
<span>And how upon its verdict hung his life.</span><br />
<span>Death's flame had touched the golden rose of love.</span><br />
<span>If it be dross or gold, the test should tell.</span><br />
<span>The black gulf night that lies 'twixt dawn and dawn,</span><br />
<span>Deepened by darker sin,&mdash;could frail love, tired</span><br />
<span>With passion, hope to bridge the perilous way?</span><br />
<span>His brain cried, "No," his heart, "Ah, Gods, but yes</span><br />
<span>Or I shall die."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i10'>He laid a tender arm</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
<span>About the shrinking child and drew her forth</span><br />
<span>Along the forest path. She did not hear</span><br />
<span>The morning birds who blithely welcomed  day,</span><br />
<span>She did not see the dew upon the leaves,</span><br />
<span>Glamour of dawn, but dazed with love and pain,</span><br />
<span>Yielding to that she knew not, kept the way</span><br />
<span>Towards the forest pool.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i10'>It seemed to them,</span><br />
<span>Waiting the unutterable moment of their loss</span><br />
<span>Or utmost gain, as tho' the swinging earth</span><br />
<span>Was emptied of all life, the very air</span><br />
<span>Seemed hollow and unearthly, breathless pause</span><br />
<span>On a great brink. They reached the pool, and Taka</span><br />
<span>Gathered her senses till her eyes were clear</span><br />
<span>As shining wells of truth. She leaned no more</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<span>Helpless upon Malua, tho' his arm</span><br />
<span>Circled her still. Before them on the path,</span><br />
<span>Noble and dead, with mute hands pleading, eyes</span><br />
<span>Subtle with secrets of eternity,</span><br />
<span>Waited Uhila.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='i8'>In a moment's space</span><br />
<span>Malua knew the utter pangs of death</span><br />
<span>Strong as his soul. And Taka must be free,</span><br />
<span>Free to decide between the mighty dead</span><br />
<span>And him, the weakest of all living men.</span><br />
<span>He spoke no word, the blood of youth once more</span><br />
<span>Fought with the skill, the power, the eloquence</span><br />
<span>Of great familiar age. If Taka drew</span><br />
<span>From out his arms and love a heart-beat's time,</span><br />
<span>She had decided, and Uhila won.</span><br />
<span>This the boy knew. Taka had seen him, Ah!</span><br />
<span>Her woman's heart in pity and distress</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
<span>Shivered as tho' cold death had laid a hand</span><br />
<span>Upon her brow. Malua felt a hell</span><br />
<span>Deep as the world, and then&mdash;the sky, pale stars,</span><br />
<span>Rose dawn, unfathomed heaven rocked in his heart</span><br />
<span>With tumult of his glory. Taka turned,</span><br />

<span>Death, life and passionate passion burned away</span><br />
<span>In the white flame of love.</span><br />
<span class='i10'>Uhila lay</span><br />
<span>Vanquished, forgotten. Turning to the sea,</span><br />
<span>Taka, Malua, children of the sun,</span><br />
<span>Went forth to meet the sunrise and the day.</span><br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
